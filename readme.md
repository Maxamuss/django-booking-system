# Django Booking System

`django-booking-system` is an open-source Django based web application for the taking and managing of bookings. Features include:

 - Creating bookings with clever assignment to available `Tables`.
 - Ability to add and manage multiple `Sites` with their own settings and resources.
 - Automated reminder emails.
 - Management of internal users.

I will be slowly adding features to this project with the hopes of making it fully useable in the near future. Suggestions and help very welcome.
